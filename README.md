# Master thesis - Leveraging cloud and machine learning technologies for the development of a knowledge IOT database
This project is my final thesis for the 'ICT for internet and multimedia' master degree @unipadova.
The thesis template is a clone of https://github.com/FIUP/Thesis-template/tree/master repo.
The projectâ€™s goal is to architect and develop a cloud-based system capable of ingesting
and processing data from heterogeneous IoT sensors so that a knowledge database can
be built.
The system must be designed to be scalable and fault-tolerant, and it must be platform-
agnostic.
