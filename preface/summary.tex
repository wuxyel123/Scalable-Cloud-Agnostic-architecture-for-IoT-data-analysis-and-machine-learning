\chapter*{Summary}

This document describes the work done during the 750-hours final project at \href{https://www.221e.com/about-us}{221e S.r.l.}\\
The project's goal is to architect and develop a cloud-based architecture capable of ingesting and processing data from heterogeneous IoT sensors and on-premises storage.\\
The system must be designed to be scalable and fault-tolerant, and it must be platform-agnostic.\\
This document is going to describe the company, the idea behind the project, the work done and an assessment of what I developed and learned during my internship.\\
