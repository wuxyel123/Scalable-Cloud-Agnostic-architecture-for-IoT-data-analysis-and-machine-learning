\section{Cloud}
This section describes the services offered by \href{https://aws.amazon.com/it/}{Amazon Web Services} and \href{https://azure.microsoft.com/it-it/}{Microsoft Azure}, exploring their features, pros and cons. 
These services are the most used cloud services in the world and they offer a wide range of services that can be used to develop the project.
It's also important to mention that these two providers were chosen right away because of the already developed experience with them, both in the company and in the author of this thesis.
